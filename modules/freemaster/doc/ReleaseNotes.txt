Freescale FreeMASTER Serial Communication Driver
================================================

FreeMASTER is a PC-based application serving as a real-time monitor, visualization 
tool, and a graphical control panel of embedded applications based on Freescale 
microcontroller and microprocessor units. The FreeMASTER Serial Communication 
Driver implements the serial interface between the target application and the host PC. 
The serial interface covers the UART/SCI and CAN communication for all supported devices, 
the EOnCE/JTAG communication for 56F8xxx family of hybrid microcontrollers and the 
USB interface for some platforms.

This driver was tested on all supported platforms in the CodeWarrior Integrated
Development Environment and in other relevant IDEs. Please see the test and example 
applications in the "example" directory. Read "readme_xxx.txt" in "src_platform" 
directories for more information about code examples.

This Communication Driver is fully documented in the User Manual located 
in the "doc" directory.

CHANGELOG
=========

Version 1.8.1  (Jun 28th 2014)
----------------------------------
- Added support for dynamically assigned SCI or CAN base address - for cases where
  compile-time optimization can not be used or is not convenient to use.
- This version of the driver is suitable to be integrated with Freescale Kinetis SDK
  version 1.0.
- New license text provided, effectively no change in license conditions and
  in terms of use.

----------------------------------
- Added support for LPUART module of the new Kinetis K22F and KV31 families
- Application example project extended to support CodeWarrior/GCC compiler.
- Fixed wrong calculation of communication buffer. This issue could make 
  Recorder or Scope initialization to fail in some scenarios.
- Initial support for Kinetis Design Studio IDE. TWR-K60 project avaliable 
  for KDS, tested with KDS version 0.2. 
- Known issue: USB CDC support not functional when using GCC compiler 
  (the issue affects both KDS and CodeWarrior projects; USB temporarily removed
  from KDS and CodeWarrior-GCC projects).  

Version 1.7.0  (Dec 15th 2013)
----------------------------------
- Added support of S12Z core and S12Z CodeWarrior compiler.
- The direct-USB communication upgraded to Freescale USB Medical stack V4.0.3.
- Added example application for TWR-K60N512 board for Keil uVision tool.
- Added example application for TWR-56F8200 board for CodeWarrior 10.4.
- Enabled compatibility with C++ applications.
- Added support of the new FlexCAN module for 56F8400 family of Digital Signal Controllers.
- Added option to enable ISR-communication handler callback.
- Updated MQX example application. New version is based on the MQX 4.1.0 release. 

Version 1.6.0  (Jul 31th 2012)
----------------------------------
- Added support of S12Z core and Cosmic compiler version 4.1.3.

Version 1.5.0  (Aug 15th 2011)
----------------------------------
- Added FreeMASTER Packet-Driven BDM driver. This driver supports communication 
  with the FreeMASTER tool and Packet-Driven BDM Plug-in. This support enables
  all FreeMASTER features to run over the BDM interface (FreeMASTER Recorder, 
  Application Commands, Target-side Addressing, Masked (bit-wise) write access 
  and other protocol features). The Packet Driven BDM Plug-in was released with 
  FreeMASTER tool V1.3.14.
- Added FMSTR_DISABLE configuration option to disable all FreeMASTER features.
  This may be useful to turn off the FreeMASTER support while leaving the source
  files in the project.
- The direct-USB communication upgraded to Freescale USB Medical stack V3.1.
- Internal header files reorganized, New file freemaster_defcfg.h is included
  in freemaster.h and set up all non defined configuration macros to dafault value.
- Added example application for Kwikstik board
- Fixed FlexCAN issue on MPC55xx, MPC56xx and Kxx platforms. FlexCAN module 
  could lose message on receives.

Version 1.4.0  (May 30th 2011)
----------------------------------
- Added FreeMASTER over USB CDC class. Use Medical USB stack 3.0 or above.
  USB CDC interface was added in EVB51JM128, M52259EVB and TWR-K60N512 example 
  application. Use with FreeMASTER tool 1.3.13 for better performance.
- New example application for DEMOJM board MC9S08JM60 processor based 
  on Code Warrior 6.3 and Code Warrior 10.1, where is USB CDC class included. 


Version 1.3.0  (Apr 15th 2011)
----------------------------------
- Implement floating point support in recorder triggering. 
  Use with FreeMASTER version 1.3.12 or above.
- Added support for Kxx Kinetis ARM Cortex-M4 devices.
- New example application for TWR-K60N512 board based on Code Warrior 10.1 and 
  IAR Embedded Workbench for ARM. 
- Added support for MQX - Real Time Operating System.
- Added standard MQX IO communication interface.
- HCS08, MCF51xx, MCF52xx example application was regenerated in Code Warrior 10.1


Version 1.2.0  (Apr 1st 2010)
----------------------------------
- Added MSCAN/FLEXCAN communication interface. Use with FreeMASTER version 1.3.10.
- FreeMASTER Lite configuration options are available to reduce code and RAM size.
- Fixed bug in Recorder initialization function (flag initialization).
- Added support for MPC56xx devices.
- Example application added for MPC5604B, MPC5604P and MPC5633M devices.
- New MPC5553EVB example application added based on CodeWarior stationery.
- Added example application for M52259EVB board.
- Added two examples for MC56F8006DEMO board based on CodeWarior stationery 
  and Processor Expert stationery.
- Added example application for 9S08DZ60 and MCF51JM128 devices.
- Support for DSC processors of MC56F8xx family was removed.
- Support for PowerPC processors of MPC5xx family was removed.
- QSUpdater tool was removed.
